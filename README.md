# Seeed Xiao Series: development platform for [PlatformIO](http://platformio.org)

The [Seeed Studio XIAO Series](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/SeeedStudio_XIAO_Series_Introduction/) is a collection of thumb-sized, powerful microcontroller units (MCUs) tailor-made for space-conscious projects requiring high performance and wireless connectivity.

## Usage

1. [Install PlatformIO](http://platformio.org)
2. Create PlatformIO project and configure a platform option in [platformio.ini](http://docs.platformio.org/page/projectconf.html) file:

```ini
[env:development]
platform = https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/platform-seeedboards.git
board = ...
framework = arduino
...
```

## Configuration

Please navigate to [documentation](http://docs.platformio.org/page/platforms/seeedxiao.html).

## Factory Reset for XIAO nRF54L15

For XIAO nRF54L15 boards, a factory reset script is provided to recover the board from a bad state (e.g., when it's can not upload due to the internal NVM write protection). This script will perform a mass erase of the flash and program a factory firmware.

### Location

The scripts are located in the `scripts/factory_reset/` directory.

### Usage

The script will automatically create and manage a local Python virtual environment to install the necessary tools, so it can be run out-of-the-box.

*   **For Windows:**
    Navigate to the `scripts/factory_reset` directory and run:
    ```powershell
    .\factory_reset.bat
    ```

*   **For Linux and macOS:**
    Navigate to the `scripts/factory_reset` directory and run:
    ```shell
    bash factory_reset.sh
    ```

### Mass Erase Only (Recover Mode)

If you only need to remove APPROTECT and wipe the device (without programming factory firmware), use the "Recover Only" scripts.

#### Usage Examples

Windows:
```powershell
cd scripts\factory_reset
./recover_only.bat
```

Linux / macOS:
```bash
cd scripts/factory_reset
bash recover_only.sh
```
